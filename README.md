# cc-tree-farm

A simple ComputerCraft tree farm using the felling turtle (or mining turtle).

## Usage

Download the program to your turtle by running `pastebin get wiut9Ra9 treefarm.lua`.
Alternatively, if you want to download directly from this repository, run `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asciiAvenger/cc-tree-farm/main/lua/treefarm.lua treefarm.lua`.
Start the program by running the command `treefarm`.
A chest must be placed directly behind the turtle and saplings must be placed into the first (top left) slot of the turtles inventory.
